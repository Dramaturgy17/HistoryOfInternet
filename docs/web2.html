                    Controlled by networks, we are being manipulated into giving our personal information and communication and how much to pay for them as well. 
                    The web medium has been changed and shaped by the people. Social media is connecting individuals in a way nothing has been able to do before. 
                    The TV industry was impossible to get in to in the past but Youtube changed everything by enabling anyone to broadcast themselves however they want.
                    Myspace was one of the first of many social websites where people shared music and files. Like Napster, Myspace benefited from the rise of social web pages.
                    Meanwhile, Hollywood and the industry used this platform as a marketing opportunity.

                    Facebook had the fortune of starting at a time where the internet was accessible to everyone. Mark Zuckerburg, it's creator, thought to embody the relationships 
                    that the people want to have by improving user experience. Media revolution has improved all our lives to be more convenient and easier. The power of technological advancement 
                    has impressed and appealed to the public. Mp3 provided a way to compress media data to be stored and played on their pc and even online. Mark initially released FaceBook
                    for Harvard students to access and use as a communicating platform. This website then became a phenomenon as more college’s students wanted this website to be 
                    available for them. Mark Zuckrberg had the ambition to create the service that would capture the totality of human connectedness. He wished to create the ultimate 
                    relationship engine.

                    Mapping out people’s relationships around the world is called a Social Graph (social network analysis). Social Graphs show that we are connected by the web of relationships. 
                    Sometimes those relationships are direct and strong, while other times it can be indirect and weak. Zuckerberg desired Facebook to be the windows of the web. Developers looking at 
                    ways to make Facebook ads better and more organized eventually led to even bigger success in the company. The peer-to-peer networking system let people share files and download them using the 
                    program Napster. This became one of the biggest controversies of technological advances in the history of the Internet. CD shops were closing as Napster became the fastest spreading software 
                    ever at the time. Hilary Rosen wanted to contact Fanning warning him to take Napster down for illegal file sharing. This became a huge threat to the value of intellectual properties and the 
                    businesses that were involved. The protection from the copywrite law was being threatened. The music industry forbid and detested the idea of downloading music without having to pay for CDs and 
                    records. However, they soon found out that the public did not care, and the music industry was left with no choice but to adapt with these new changes. Along with this revolution, Youtube gained more 
                    and more popularity and success.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Napster was shut down after the court case of copywrite issues and iTunes was given the permission to provide music files that cost 99 cents apiece. Youtube became a part of this issue as another 
                    threat to the music industry. This was a tougher case for the music industry to win because Youtube was already a huge platform powered by Google. The Internet gives people the opportunity for 
                    entertainment produced by themselves rather than content that big industries want to sell. A new era emerged as the internet presented the entertainment created by the crowd. 
                    This Era is known as Web 2 .0.

                    Through blogging, ordinary people are able to express their thoughts and experiences. The newspaper became less and less significant and their business model was being questioned for effectiveness. 
                    Cyberspace belongs to us and accessing media should always be easy and feel good to interact with. In this age, anyone can be an author, despite thier credentials or lack thereof. The Internet will 
                    continue to grow and the general direction of that growth seems to include a faster, bigger, more social, more consuming, and more enveloping experience with each new innovation.
